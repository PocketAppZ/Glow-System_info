# Glow - System Analysis Software

**Glow** is a **system analysis software** developed by **Eray TÃ¼rkay**. It allows you to show the hardware and software features of your computer in an easy way. Programmed only with **C# and .NET Framework**. And it's **completely free**!

# My Vision

*I developed Glow so that people can easily see system features and get detailed information about their system without paying any fees.
Glow is completely free and open source software. Glow does not require an internet connection. For this reason, only you can see your computer information.
The main purpose of Glow is to make it a user-friendly software that even people who do not understand anything about computers can easily use and get information easily.
The difference from other system analysis software is that **everything is free**, it has a **user-friendly interface**, it has an **easy-to-access** layout, and most importantly, it provides **100% privacy**.*
